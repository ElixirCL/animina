# Docker Compose

Alternatively you may want to run the application using Docker-Compose. This is not supported officially!

&#x26a0;&#xfe0f; For development only. Don't use in production!

On a Mac, please install [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/) first. (Other variants of Docker and Docker-Compose may or may not work.)

Build the images: `docker-compose build`

Run the containers: `docker-compose up`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
